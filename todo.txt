backlog
- handle transition out of match 
    - Allow surrendering
    - Handle server / client disconnect
    - Better UI for win / lose game
    - UI for when "waiting on player" (no inputs received), allow player to be kicked after time, handle win / loss as necessary based on kick
    - Allow game to continue even if a player drops / leaves?
    - Chat, is this real?
- (do this when you make trainable wagons) click-based drops for wagon
- (polish) pressing hotkeys should cause a button-press effect in the UI
- (polish) moving the wagon feels unintuitive because the wagon moves so that its top-left matches the cell you clicked. is there a way we can make the movement more center-aligned?
    seems like we would have to rework how the movement message is sent to do this, and we would have to account for groups of different sized units.
