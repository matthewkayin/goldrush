Hi welcome back

We're fixing all the signed conversion warnings
We've decided that everything that is only ever going to be positive should be an unsigned int
But we have to be careful because sometimes we have out-of-bounds cell values and we've just been checking that they're in bounds, 
    but we need to make sure now that they don't overflow the unsigned int if we cast to unsigned int
Also the noise map values have been changed to be uint8_t with NOISE_VALUE constants as their values
Make sure that the NOISE_VALUE constants get used throughout the code and make sure that the type used for noise values throughout the code is correct
Also the lcg_rand got changed to use uint32_t, so make sure that everyone is on board with that. main.cpp probably casts to int32_t
