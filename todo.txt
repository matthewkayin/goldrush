todos

- map generation
- hold position, also make it so that units will attack and follow if they are on idle,
  also make sure that when units are attacked they only attack back if they are not attacking 
  i.e. if they are attacking unit A and unit B attacks them, they should continue to attack unit A
  also should I have a move command that moves and ignores attacks? or should that just be the default?

backlog
- replace percent to win with a UI ticker (maybe vertical UI? either way, use colored arrows and hide usernames unless hovered)
- handle transition out of match 
    - Allow surrendering
    - Handle server / client disconnect
    - Better UI for win / lose game
    - UI for when "waiting on player" (no inputs received), allow player to be kicked after time, handle win / loss as necessary based on kick
    - Allow game to continue even if a player drops / leaves?
    - Chat, is this real?
- (do this when you make trainable wagons) click-based drops for wagon
- (polish) pressing hotkeys should cause a button-press effect in the UI
- (polish) moving the wagon feels unintuitive because the wagon moves so that its top-left matches the cell you clicked. is there a way we can make the movement more center-aligned?
    seems like we would have to rework how the movement message is sent to do this, and we would have to account for groups of different sized units.
