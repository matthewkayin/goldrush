- (bug / polish) A-move doesn't always work like you would expect, implement priority system?
- replace percent to win with a UI ticker (maybe vertical UI? either way, use colored arrows and hide usernames unless hovered)
- (polish) pressing hotkeys should cause a button-press effect in the UI
- (polish) moving the wagon feels unintuitive because the wagon moves so that its top-left matches the cell you clicked. is there a way we can make the movement more center-aligned?
    seems like we would have to rework how the movement message is sent to do this, and we would have to account for groups of different sized units.
